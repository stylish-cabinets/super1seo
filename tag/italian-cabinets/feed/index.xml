										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://stylish-cabinets.com/portfolio/young/"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-7109 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Young-01-7-scaled-1-1024x596.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="596" /></a></p>
<p>The kitchen is more than just a functional space for meal preparation; it&#8217;s a central hub for socializing and creating lasting memories. The design of your kitchen plays a significant role in shaping its ambiance, and one often underestimated element is lighting. In particular, the strategic use of lighting can accentuate and showcase your kitchen cabinets, transforming the entire space. In this article, we&#8217;ll explore the pivotal role that lighting plays in showcasing your kitchen cabinets and enhancing the overall aesthetics of your culinary haven.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="size-full wp-image-7890 alignright" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/light2.png" alt="" width="382" height="638" /></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Under-Cabinet Lighting:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Illuminating Workspaces:</strong> Under-cabinet lighting serves a dual purpose by not only adding a touch of elegance to your kitchen but also illuminating countertops and workspaces. This makes food preparation more efficient and enhances safety.</li>
<li><strong>LED Strips:</strong> LED strips are a popular choice for under-cabinet lighting due to their energy efficiency and versatility. They can be easily installed to provide a subtle and even glow, showcasing the details of your cabinets without creating harsh shadows.</li>
<li><strong>Warm vs. Cool Lighting:</strong> Consider the color temperature of the lights. Warm lights (around 2700K) create a cozy and inviting atmosphere, while cooler lights (around 4000K) can contribute to a modern and clean look.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>In-Cabinet Lighting:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Highlighting Contents:</strong> If you have glass-front cabinets or open shelving, consider incorporating in-cabinet lighting to showcase the contents. This adds a decorative element and draws attention to your curated collection of dishware or décor.</li>
<li><strong>Adjustable Fixtures:</strong> Use adjustable fixtures to direct light precisely where you want it. This allows you to highlight specific items or create visual interest within your cabinets.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Overhead Pendant Lights:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Focal Points:</strong> Pendant lights strategically placed above kitchen islands or dining areas can serve as focal points, drawing attention to specific areas of your kitchen. This not only complements your cabinet design but also contributes to the overall aesthetic.</li>
<li><strong>Stylish Designs:</strong> Choose pendant lights with stylish designs that complement your cabinet style. This creates a cohesive and well-coordinated look, enhancing the visual appeal of the entire space.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Toe-Kick Lighting:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Creating Depth:</strong> Adding lighting to the toe kicks beneath your cabinets creates a sense of depth and dimension in your kitchen. This subtle illumination can be especially impactful in the evening, giving your kitchen a warm and inviting glow.</li>
<li><strong>Guiding Pathways:</strong> Toe-kick lighting also serves a practical purpose by subtly guiding pathways in the kitchen. This can be particularly useful during nighttime visits to the kitchen.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Cabinet Uplighting:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Accentuating Height:</strong> Uplighting on top of cabinets can accentuate the height of your kitchen, especially in spaces with high ceilings. This creates a visually striking effect and showcases the architectural features of your cabinetry.</li>
<li><strong>Decorative Lighting:</strong> Consider using decorative fixtures or recessed lighting on top of cabinets to add a touch of sophistication. This type of lighting can also highlight any decorative items displayed on top of the cabinets.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Dimmer Controls:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Versatility:</strong> Install dimmer controls for your cabinet lighting to adjust the intensity based on different occasions. Dimming the lights during intimate dinners or increasing brightness for cooking can create a versatile and adaptable kitchen environment.</li>
<li><strong>Mood Enhancement:</strong> The ability to control the brightness of your cabinet lighting allows you to set the mood in your kitchen. Experiment with different levels of illumination to find what works best for different activities.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong><img decoding="async" class="wp-image-7889 size-medium alignleft" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/light1-300x233.png" alt="" width="300" height="233" /></strong>Conclusion:</p>
<p>Lighting is a powerful tool in interior design, and when used strategically, it can transform your kitchen cabinets from mere storage units into focal points of elegance and style. Whether you opt for under-cabinet lights to enhance functionality, in-cabinet lights to showcase your treasures, or pendant lights to create a visual centerpiece, the right lighting can elevate your kitchen to new heights. By considering the type of lighting, placement, and design, you can craft a <a href="https://stylish-cabinets.com/">well-lit kitchen</a> that not only serves its practical purposes but also captivates with its beauty and ambiance.</p>

From classic to contemporary, the variety of door styles available allows homeowners to tailor their kitchen to match their personal taste and the overall style of their home. In this article, we&#8217;ll explore the impact of different cabinet door styles on kitchen design and offer insights to help you choose the perfect doors for your culinary haven.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Shaker Style Doors:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Timeless Elegance:</strong> Shaker style doors are known for their clean lines, simple design, and timeless elegance. They suit a variety of kitchen styles, from traditional to modern, making them a versatile choice.</li>
<li><strong>Versatility:</strong> The simplicity of Shaker doors provides a neutral backdrop, allowing you to experiment with different finishes, hardware, and accessories. This versatility makes them a popular option for those who enjoy evolving their kitchen&#8217;s aesthetic over time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Flat Panel Doors:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Modern Simplicity:</strong> Flat panel doors, also known as slab doors, exude a sense of modern simplicity. They feature a flat, unadorned surface that contributes to a clean and streamlined look in contemporary kitchens.</li>
<li><strong>Minimalistic Appeal:</strong> These doors work well in minimalist designs, allowing other elements in the kitchen, such as bold colors or intricate backsplashes, to take center stage. Flat panel doors are an excellent choice for achieving a sleek and uncluttered appearance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Raised Panel Doors:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Traditional Elegance:</strong> Raised panel doors are a hallmark of traditional kitchen design. They feature a center panel that is elevated or raised, adding a touch of detail and sophistication to the cabinetry.</li>
<li><strong>Warmth and Character:</strong> This style is often associated with a sense of warmth and character, making it ideal for kitchens that aim to create a cozy and inviting atmosphere. Raised panel doors can be complemented with decorative molding for an extra layer of elegance.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Inset Doors:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Craftsman Precision:</strong> Inset doors are set into the cabinet frame rather than overlaying it. This style requires meticulous craftsmanship and attention to detail, providing a look reminiscent of fine furniture.</li>
<li><strong>Heritage Charm:</strong> Inset doors are often associated with traditional and craftsman-style kitchens. Their precise fit and tailored appearance contribute to a timeless and enduring charm that can enhance the character of any home.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Glass Front Doors:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Display and Illuminate:</strong> Glass front doors offer the opportunity to showcase dishware, collectibles, or decorative items. They can be clear, frosted, or textured, allowing you to control the level of visibility and add a layer of interest to your cabinets.</li>
<li><strong>Open and Airy Feel:</strong> Glass front doors contribute to an open and airy feel in the kitchen. They can visually expand the space, making them an excellent choice for smaller kitchens or those with limited natural light.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Louvered Doors:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cottage or Coastal Vibe:</strong> Louvered doors feature horizontal slats that provide a distinctive look, often associated with cottage or coastal design styles. They evoke a sense of casual elegance and can introduce a unique texture to the kitchen.</li>
<li><strong>Ventilation:</strong> Louvered doors are not only aesthetically pleasing but also practical. The slats allow for ventilation, making them suitable for cabinets that house appliances like dishwashers or laundry machines.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Distressed or Reclaimed Doors:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rustic Charm:</strong> Distressed or reclaimed doors contribute to a rustic and well-worn charm. This style adds character and a sense of history to the kitchen, making it feel like a welcoming and lived-in space.</li>
<li><strong>Individuality:</strong> The imperfections and unique features of distressed or reclaimed doors make each cabinet door one-of-a-kind. This is an ideal choice for those who appreciate a personalized and eclectic look in their kitchen.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Conclusion:</p>
<p>Selecting the right cabinet door style is a crucial decision that can significantly impact the overall design of your kitchen. Whether you lean towards the timeless elegance of Shaker doors, the modern simplicity of flat panel doors, or the traditional charm of raised panel doors, each style contributes its own character to the space. Consider your personal taste, the architectural style of your home, and the atmosphere you want to create in your kitchen.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://stylish-cabinets.com/portfolio/natural"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-7136 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Modello-Natural_2022-scaled-1-1024x657.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="657" /></a></p>
<p>When it comes to choosing cabinets for your kitchen, bathroom, or any living space, understanding the diverse range of materials is key to making informed decisions. Let&#8217;s delve into the pros and cons of popular cabinet materials, shedding light on the unique characteristics of wood, MDF (Medium-Density Fiberboard), plywood, and particleboard.</p>
<p><strong><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-7871 size-medium" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/plywood-mdf-particle-board-300x204.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="204" /></strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Wood Cabinets: Timeless Elegance and Durability</strong></p>
<p><em>Pros:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Aesthetic Appeal:</strong> Wood cabinets bring a timeless and classic aesthetic to any space. The natural grains and variations in wood lend warmth and character.</li>
<li><strong>Durability:</strong> High-quality wood, such as oak, maple, or cherry, is renowned for its durability, ensuring cabinets that withstand the test of time.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Cons:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cost:</strong> Wood cabinets can be more expensive than alternatives due to the higher cost of quality wood materials.</li>
<li><strong>Susceptibility to Moisture:</strong> While sealed properly, wood is susceptible to expansion and contraction with changes in humidity.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. MDF (Medium-Density Fiberboard) Cabinets: Affordability and Versatility</strong></p>
<p><em>Pros:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Affordability:</strong> MDF is a cost-effective option, making it an attractive choice for budget-conscious projects.</li>
<li><strong>Versatility:</strong> Its smooth surface allows for easy customization, making it ideal for painted finishes and intricate detailing.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Cons:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Susceptibility to Moisture:</strong> Like wood, MDF is sensitive to moisture and can swell or warp if not properly sealed.</li>
<li><strong>Durability:</strong> While durable, it may not be as sturdy as solid wood in high-impact areas.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Plywood Cabinets: Strength and Stability</strong></p>
<p><em>Pros:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Strength:</strong> Plywood is known for its strength and stability, making it a reliable choice for cabinets.</li>
<li><strong>Resistance to Moisture:</strong> Properly sealed plywood is less susceptible to moisture-related issues compared to MDF.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Cons:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cost:</strong> Plywood tends to be more expensive than MDF and particleboard.</li>
<li><strong>Appearance:</strong> The layered structure may not have the same aesthetic appeal as solid wood.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Particleboard Cabinets: Budget-Friendly and Efficient</strong></p>
<p><em>Pros:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Affordability:</strong> Particleboard is the most budget-friendly option, making it accessible for various projects.</li>
<li><strong>Uniformity:</strong> Its consistent density allows for a smooth, uniform finish.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Cons:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Susceptibility to Moisture:</strong> Particleboard is highly susceptible to damage from moisture and may not hold up well in humid environments.</li>
<li><strong>Durability:</strong> It is less durable than plywood or solid wood, making it more prone to damage.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Choosing Wisely: Tailoring Materials to Your Needs</strong></p>
<p>Selecting the right cabinet material involves weighing the pros and cons against your specific needs, budget, and design preferences. Consider the environment in which the cabinets will be installed, your desired aesthetic, and the level of maintenance you&#8217;re comfortable with.</p>
<p>Each material brings its own set of characteristics to the table, offering a spectrum of options for every homeowner. Whether you prioritize the timeless elegance of wood, the affordability of MDF, the strength of plywood, or the budget-friendly efficiency of particleboard, your choice will play a pivotal role in creating a functional and visually appealing space.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://stylish-cabinets.com/portfolio/color-trend"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" class="aligncenter wp-image-7147 size-large" src="/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Color-Trend-02-1-1024x464.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="464" /></a></p>
<p>When it comes to kitchen or bathroom renovations, one of the critical decisions homeowners face is whether to invest in custom-made cabinets or opt for stock cabinets. Both options come with their unique advantages and disadvantages, and the choice ultimately depends on individual preferences, budget constraints, and the specific requirements of the space. In this article, we&#8217;ll explore and compare the key aspects of custom and stock cabinets to help you make an informed decision for your next cabinetry project.</p>
<p>Custom Cabinets:</p>
<p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Tailored to Your Space:</strong> Custom cabinets are built to fit the exact dimensions of your kitchen or bathroom. This means that every inch of available space is utilized efficiently, providing a seamless and polished look.</li>
<li><strong>Personalization:</strong> With custom cabinets, you have control over the design, materials, and finishes. This level of personalization allows you to create a unique and distinctive look that complements your overall home aesthetic.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://stylish-cabinets.com/">High-Quality Craftsmanship</a>:</strong> Custom cabinets are typically crafted by skilled artisans, ensuring a higher level of craftsmanship. This often translates to durable and long-lasting cabinets that can withstand the test of time.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Higher Cost:</strong> The most significant drawback of custom cabinets is their cost. Due to the personalized design and craftsmanship involved, custom cabinets tend to be more expensive than their stock counterparts.</li>
<li><strong>Longer Lead Times:</strong> Since custom cabinets are made to order, they usually have longer lead times. If you&#8217;re working on a tight schedule, this extended production time might be a drawback.</li>
</ol>
<p>Stock Cabinets:</p>
<p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Cost-Effective:</strong> Stock cabinets are mass-produced, making them more affordable than custom options. If you&#8217;re on a budget, stock cabinets provide a cost-effective solution without compromising on quality.</li>
<li><strong>Quick Availability:</strong> Stock cabinets are readily available and can be purchased off-the-shelf from home improvement stores. This quick availability is advantageous for those who need a faster turnaround time for their cabinetry project.</li>
<li><strong>Variety of Styles and Finishes:</strong> Stock cabinets come in a wide range of styles, finishes, and sizes, providing homeowners with plenty of options to choose from. This versatility allows you to find a suitable style that fits your design preferences.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Disadvantages:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Limited Customization:</strong> The main drawback of stock cabinets is the limited customization options. While you can choose from a variety of styles, you may not find the perfect fit for your unique space.</li>
<li><strong>Standard Sizing:</strong> Stock cabinets are produced in standard sizes, which may not be an ideal fit for irregularly shaped or non-standard spaces. This can result in unused or awkward spaces in your <a href="https://stylish-cabinets.com/">kitchen or bathroom</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Conclusion:</p>
<p>In the debate between custom and stock cabinets, there is no one-size-fits-all answer. The right choice depends on your budget, timeline, and the level of customization you desire. If you have a specific vision for your space and are willing to invest in personalized craftsmanship, <a href="https://stylish-cabinets.com/">custom cabinets</a> may be the way to go. On the other hand, if cost efficiency and quick availability are top priorities, stock cabinets offer a practical and stylish solution. Ultimately, the key is to carefully weigh the advantages and disadvantages of each option to determine which aligns best with your needs and preferences.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://stylish-cabinets.com/"><strong>Italian kitchen</strong></a> design is renowned for its timeless elegance and impeccable craftsmanship, and a significant contributor to this reputation is the meticulous selection of premium materials for cabinetry. In this article, we will delve into the world of high-quality choices for Italian cabinetry, exploring the use of solid wood, lacquer, and high-gloss finishes that elevate these kitchens to the epitome of sophistication.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Solid Wood: The Heart of Italian Craftsmanship</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>At the core of many Italian kitchen cabinets lies the warmth and authenticity of solid wood. Renowned for its durability and natural beauty, solid wood adds a touch of luxury to any kitchen space. Common choices include oak, walnut, and cherry, each imbuing the cabinets with a unique grain pattern that tells a story of quality craftsmanship. The tactile and visual appeal of solid wood contributes to the enduring charm of Italian kitchens, creating a timeless backdrop for culinary creativity.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Lacquer: Sleek Sophistication and Endless Possibilities</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Lacquer is a staple in Italian cabinetry, offering a sleek and modern finish that complements the traditional craftsmanship of the cabinets. The application of lacquer results in a smooth, glossy surface that reflects light, enhancing the overall brightness of the kitchen. White and neutral tones are popular choices, creating a canvas that allows other design elements to shine. Lacquered Italian cabinets not only exude sophistication but also embrace a contemporary aesthetic, making them adaptable to a range of kitchen styles.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>High-Gloss Finishes: Reflecting Brilliance and Style</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>For those seeking the pinnacle of modern luxury, high-gloss finishes take <a href="https://stylish-cabinets.com/">Italian cabinetry</a> to new heights. The reflective surfaces of high-gloss cabinets not only make a bold design statement but also serve a functional purpose by amplifying natural light and creating an illusion of space. These finishes are often seen in monochromatic color schemes, such as deep blacks, vibrant reds, or pristine whites, adding a sense of drama and opulence to the kitchen environment.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Balancing Tradition and Innovation: Material Combinations</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://stylish-cabinets.com/">Italian kitchen designers</a> are adept at harmoniously combining different materials to achieve a balanced and visually striking result. It&#8217;s not uncommon to see solid wood cabinets paired with lacquered elements or high-gloss finishes used selectively to highlight specific design features. This blending of traditional and innovative materials is a testament to the adaptability of Italian design principles, creating kitchens that are not only functional but also works of art.</p>
<p>Conclusion:</p>
<p>In the realm of Italian cabinetry, materials matter—a commitment to quality that transcends trends and fads. Whether it&#8217;s the timeless allure of solid wood, the sleek sophistication of lacquer, or the high-gloss finishes that reflect brilliance and style, Italian kitchens stand as a testament to the enduring marriage of form and function. By understanding and appreciating the premium materials used in Italian cabinetry, one can embark on a journey to create a kitchen that is not just a space for culinary pursuits but a haven of enduring beauty and craftsmanship.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A <a href="https://stylish-cabinets.com/">well-designed kitchen</a> is not just about aesthetics but also about functionality and convenience. In North America, established standards guide the distances between various work centers to ensure an efficient and ergonomic culinary space.</p>
<p><strong>1. Work Triangle Concept:</strong></p>
<p>At the heart of North American kitchen design is the concept of the work triangle. This triangle connects the three primary work centers in the kitchen: the sink, the stove, and the refrigerator. The idea is to create an efficient layout that minimizes unnecessary movements and enhances workflow.</p>
<p><strong>2. Distances Between Work Centers:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sink to Stove:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The distance between the sink and stove is a critical consideration. Ideally, there should be a clear and unobstructed path between these two work centers to facilitate the easy transfer of pots, pans, and ingredients. The standard distance is recommended to be between 12 to 36 inches.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Sink to Refrigerator:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The sink and refrigerator are two frequently used areas in the kitchen. Maintaining a reasonable distance (ideally between 36 to 72 inches) ensures that you can seamlessly move from washing and prepping at the sink to accessing fresh produce in the refrigerator.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Stove to Refrigerator:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The distance between the stove and refrigerator should be carefully considered. This ensures that ingredients can be easily transferred from the refrigerator to the stove during cooking. The recommended standard distance is typically between 36 to 72 inches.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Additional Considerations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clear Pathways:</strong>
<ul>
<li>It&#8217;s essential to maintain clear pathways between these work centers. Avoiding obstacles and ensuring there&#8217;s enough space for movement contribute to a safer and more efficient kitchen.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>User Convenience:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Consider the convenience of the primary kitchen user. The goal is to minimize unnecessary steps, making it more comfortable to move between work areas and enhancing the overall cooking experience.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Flexibility in Design:</strong></p>
<p>While these standards provide valuable guidelines, flexibility in design is also crucial. Individual preferences, kitchen size, and layout variations may necessitate adjustments to these distances. Customizing the work center layout to suit specific needs ensures a kitchen that aligns perfectly with the user&#8217;s lifestyle.</p>
<p>In conclusion, North American standards for work center distances aim to create kitchens that are not only aesthetically pleasing but also highly functional. Adhering to these guidelines ensures an optimized layout, promoting efficiency and ease of use in the heart of every home. Whether you&#8217;re a seasoned chef or an occasional cook, these standards contribute to a kitchen that is a joy to work in.</p>

<p><a href="https://stylish-cabinets.com/">Stosa Cucine</a> won the FSC® Furniture Award for the third consecutive year, in the category FSC Communication Award. In addition to the production of certified series models, is particularly rearded the commitment that Stosa has shown in conveying the certification assets on all its communication channels. Press conferences, live social talks and social influencers linked to the furniture sector: these are the projects promoted by <a href="https://stylish-cabinets.com/">Stosa</a> to convey the values ​​of FSC®. We recall the events at the Corso Sempione flagship store in Milan with representatives of the press, and above all the talk with FSC Italy which took place in Milan during the Salone del Mobile.</p>
<p>The final ceremony of the FSC® Furniture Awards 2022 took place on October 28 in Milan, at the ADI Design Museum. At the round table chaired by Mauro Masiero (President of FSC Italia) and focused on the themes of sustainable production in the furniture sector in Europe, which hosted among others Jeremy Harrison (Chief Markets Officer FSC International), Maria Porro (President of the Salone del Mobile) and Diego Florian (Director of FSC Italy), followed by the award ceremony that saw Stosa triumph in the Communication category with the following mention:</p>
<p>“The award goes to a large Family-owned Italian company that has been producing quality Kitchens for over 55 years. Thanks to his commitment to sustainability, customers can now find many FSC-certified Kitchens among the company’s product range. It is FSC-certified since 2012 and joined FSC Italy’s webpartner program in 2021. This company made continuous investments in communication to strengthen the customer’s and media’s awareness on FSC. When targeting consumers, it embraced many different channels: from the more traditional ones like TV, to social media campaigns and innovative events with influencers active in the design-furniture world. During the 2022 Salone del Mobile in Milan, an Instagram live talk was held at the company’s booth to present the long collaboration with FSC, explaining what it means to be FSC certified and underlying the common values ​​between the two organizations. The influencer relaunched the event on their official profiles, giving great echo to the debate and to FSC. “</p>
<p>Always focused to the theme of sustainability and forests stewardship, <a href="https://stylish-cabinets.com/">Stosa Cucine</a> continues to take concrete actions to make its production increasingly green, adopting solutions aimed at energy saving and reducing pollution and above all contributing to spreading the culture of eco-sustainability with communication campaigns in a market that is increasingly aware of the importance of these issues.</p>
